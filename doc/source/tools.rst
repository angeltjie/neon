Command Line Tools
==================


neon
----
.. autosummary::
   neon.util.argparser.NeonArgparser

The following includes a description of the command line arguments that can be
passed to neon python scripts or to the ``neon`` executable.

.. literalinclude:: neon_help_output.txt

nvis
----
``nvis`` reads hdf5 data written out by neon callbacks and generates Bokeh_
visualizations embedded in html.

.. _Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/

Note that Bokeh_ and ``nvis`` are not installed by default.  To enable these
be sure to first install via ``make -e VIS=true`` (or edit the Makefile to set
the ``VIS`` variable).  If you've already installed neon without enabling
visualization dependencies you'll need to ``touch vis_requirements.txt`` prior
to the ``make -e VIS=true`` call to ensure virtualenv python dependencies get
triggered.

Visualization of training and validation set cost on an epoch or minibatch
axis is currently supported. Deconv, direct and histogram visualizations of
layer parameters are planned for an upcoming release.

The following example shows dumping training cost data from ``neon`` and
visualizing it via ``nvis``:

.. code-block:: bash

    neon examples/mnist_mlp.yaml -o data.h5
    nvis -i data.h5 -o data.html

If validation cost is computed in ``neon``, it will also be saved and
visualized by ``nvis``:

.. code-block:: bash

    neon examples/mnist_mlp.yaml -o data.h5 --validation_freq 1
    nvis -i data.h5 -o data.html

Script examples not directly using the ``neon`` command can still dump
visualization data:


.. code-block:: bash

    examples/cifar10_allcnn.py -o data.h5
    nvis -i data.h5 -o data.html
